<h1 class="title">sendmail access.db by example - enumeration order</h1>
<p>
It seems that the first match of an IP address is used for a particular connection.
</p>
<p>
If you want to enumerate the entire IP space, you can specify OK and RELAY early
and finish off with possible REJECT for a complete enumeration.
</p>
<p>
That is better than attempting to proceed through the entire space in order,
which would tempt you to mix OK and RELAY with REJECT, and
apparently needing to specify REJECT for all subnets at the same level
as OK or RELAY.  (Example perhaps needed).
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<p>
To enable relaying for subnet 142.150.210 but disable for all others,
the temptation (in order to specify all subnets in order) might be to write...
</p>
<pre>
Connect: 0	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 139	REJECT
Connect: 140	REJECT
Connect: 141	REJECT
Connect: 142.1	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 142.149	REJECT
Connect: 142.150.0	REJECT
Connect: 142.150.1	REJECT
Connect: 142.150.2	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 142.150.209	REJECT
Connect: 142.150.210	RELAY
Connect: 142.150.211	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 142.150.255	REJECT
Connect: 142.151	REJECT
Connect: 142.152	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 142.254	REJECT
Connect: 142.255	REJECT
Connect: 143	REJECT
Connect: 144	REJECT
[...]
Connect: 253	REJECT
Connect: 254	REJECT
Connect: 255	REJECT
</pre>
<p>
However, you can more simplify specify all the success results first,
and finish with general rejects which, while they would include those
same addresses, will not in fact be evaluated.
</p>
<pre>
Connect: 142.150.211	REJECT
#
Connect: 0	REJECT

Connect: 139	REJECT
Connect: 140	REJECT
Connect: 141	REJECT
Connect: 142	REJECT
Connect: 143	REJECT
Connect: 144	REJECT

Connect: 253	REJECT
Connect: 254	REJECT
Connect: 255	REJECT

<p>
Which is much shorter and actually clearer.
</p>
<p>
The difference is even more drastic in IPv6.
</p>
<p>
If you mix reference by name and IP, it's not clear what happens.
It does not seem that all names are evaluated to IP before use.
Ultimately, it seems best to use IP only.  (Especially as hosts begin
to have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses).
</p>

<p>
While ranges of addresses can be specificed by prefixes, I have found no
way to specify a range of prefixes.
</p>
<p>
If you want to enumerate the entire IP space, you will need 256 lines for IPv4
and 65536(!) lines for IPv6.
Luckily, that does seem to work.
