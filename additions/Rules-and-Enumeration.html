<h1 class="title">sendmail access.db by example - enumeration order</h1>
<p>
It seems that the first match of an IP address is used for a particular connection.
</p>
<p>
If you want to enumerate the entire IP space, you can specify OK and RELAY early
and finish off with possible REJECT for a complete enumeration.
</p>
<p>
That is better than attempting to proceed through the entire space in order,
which would tempt you to mix OK and RELAY with REJECT, and
apparently needing to specify REJECT for all subnets at the same level
as OK or RELAY.  (Example perhaps needed).
</p>
<p>
If you mix reference by name and IP, it's not clear what happens.
It does not seem that all names are evaluated to IP before use.
Ultimately, it seems best to use IP only.
</p>

<p>
While ranges of addresses can be specificed by prefixes, I have found no
way to specify a range of prefixes.
</p>
<p>
If you want to enumerate the entire IP space, you will need 256 lines for IPv4
and 65536(!) lines for IPv6.
Luckily, that does seem to work.
