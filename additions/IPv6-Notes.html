<h1 class="title">sendmail access.db by example</h1>
<p>Since "/etc/mail/access" is a database, after creating the text file, use makemap to create the database map.  </p>
<p><div class="codeblock"><code># makemap hash /etc/mail/access.db &lt; /etc/mail/access</code></div></p>
<p>Below is what my access file currently looks like and can be used as a starting point. All internal addresses have been changed except for spammers!!</p>
<p>
Below are more examples and explanations for reference which comes from the sendmail-cf distribution docs.</p>
<p>The table itself uses e-mail addresses, domain names, and network numbers as keys. </p>
<p>Note that IPv6 addresses must be prefaced with "IPv6:".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
        spammer@aol.com                 REJECT
        cyberspammer.com                REJECT
        TLD                             REJECT
        192.168.212                     REJECT
        IPv6:2002:c0a8:02c7             RELAY
        IPv6:2002:c0a8:51d2::23f4       REJECT
</pre>

<p>
Note that IPv6:2002:c0a8:51d2::23f4 is not interpreted as a full address.
It is interpreted as 2002:c0a8:51d2:0:23f4:0:0:0.  To get what would
normally be written as 2002:c0a8:51d2::23f4 you would need
2002:c0a8:51d2:0:0:0:0:23f4.
</p>

<p>
Similarly note that IPv6:2002:c0a8:02c7: would be interpreted (I think) as
IPv6:2002:c0a8:02c7:0/64.  But then IPv4 needs to avoid trailing ".",
so IPv6 is merely similar.
