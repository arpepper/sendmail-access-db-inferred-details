Actually I expand upon...

http://www.linuxweblog.com/sendmail-accessdb-example

it was a copy of ?

http://www.sendmail.org/m4/anti_spam.html

That seems to have moved to

http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/doc8.12/cf/m4/anti_spam.html

with some expansion.  But not a lot of extra access.db info.


Strangely, I thought I had a lot to say.  But a couple of key short points
vastly improved my own understanding.  So it seems I probably don't need to
create anything very exetensive.
